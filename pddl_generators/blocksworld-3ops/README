## Blocksworld-3ops

*   Origin: Goes back to the annals of AI, seems to be first mentioned in
    Terry Winograd's PhD thesis 1972. In a 1974 planning paper by Gerald
    Sussman. Taken from the [IPP][6] domain collection.
*   Adaptions: None.
*   Description: Classical untyped STRIPS domain, where stackable blocks
    need to be re-assembled on a table with unlimited space.
    Representation uses 3 operators, moving a block from the table to
    another block, a block from another block to the table, or a block
    from a block to another block. Semantically, the representation does
    not use a robot arm, in difference to the 4 operator representation
    below. The initial state specifies a complete state, the goal state
    specifies only the on relations required between any two blocks.
*   Parameters: Number of blocks.
*   Generation: Uses random blocksworld state generator provided by John
    Slaney and Sylvie Thiebaux. Simply translates two such states into
    PDDL, and prints them out as the initial state and the goal state,
    where the latter state has all facts removed except the on relations
    between blocks.
